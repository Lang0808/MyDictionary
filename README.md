# MyDictionary
Have you ever seen a word that you knew its meaning, but you have forgotten it ?<br/>
This application helps you save your own definition about words you met.<br/>
Not only save meaning of the word, you can also save (note) its usage, how to use it, and its synonym.<br/>
Deploy: https://dictionary-cua-toi.herokuapp.com/ <br/>
I don't have any skill in security so please do not spam and create too much account <br/>
Function change definition of specific word has an error in Firefox, this stuff makes me very sad because Firefox is my favorite web browser<br/>
But everything still well on Edge and Chrome<br/>
